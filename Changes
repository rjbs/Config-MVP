          Sections, Sequences, and Assemblers  can now be finalized

          the Assembler finalizes things as appropriate

          Sections can refer to their containing Sequence

          Sequences can refer to their constructing Assembler

          bundles now can (and should) provide payload as an arrayref

          Assembler->begin_section can be given a reference to a package name
          to skip rewriting

          the replace_bundle_with_contents method is used by
          Assembler::WithBundles to convert bundle sections into contents

          much more documentation yet again

0.092210  2009-08-09
          package interrogation (for mvp_* settings) is now done in Section
            initialization; this means you don't need to use the Assembler to
            benefit from this feature

          much more documentation
